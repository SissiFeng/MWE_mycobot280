# Robot Arm Simulator

This Streamlit app simulates a robot arm moving and manipulating bottles in a laboratory setting. Users can control the arm's movement, grab and release bottles, and run a predefined bottle transfer task.

## Features

- 2D visualization of a robot arm in a laboratory environment
- Interactive control of the robot arm's position
- Simulation of bottle grabbing and releasing
- Predefined bottle transfer task demonstration

## How to use

1. Use the sliders in the sidebar to set the target X and Y coordinates for the robot arm.
2. Click the "Move Robot Arm" button to move the arm to the target position.
3. Use the "Grab Bottle" and "Release Bottle" buttons to interact with bottles.
4. Click "Execute Bottle Transfer Task" to see a demonstration of the arm moving bottles between stations.

Note: This is a simulation for demonstration purposes only and does not represent a real robotic system.
